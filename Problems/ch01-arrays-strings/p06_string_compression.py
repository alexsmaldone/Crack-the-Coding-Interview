# Implement method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters
# for example, 'aabccccaaa' would become 'a2b1c4a3'
# If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, reuturn the original string
#  Can assume that string has only uuppercase and lowercase letters
